## üí° Idea:
It is a Pomodoro timer that manages time for people. It works with 25-minute intervals, at each interval a exercise challenge, such as 'eye or body exercise', will be launch for the user, so the user won't forget to exercise time-to-time itself.  
For each accomplish the user will receive points as rewards.  
The idea of this project was to learn more about **React with Typescript**, and the use of **NextJS**.
